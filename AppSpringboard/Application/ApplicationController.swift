 I don't like to use the singleton pattern a lot, but here's one case where I do. This class can be
 used to get/set application state, update navigation, or respond to system events without complicated
 logic drilling into the navigation structure of your app from an arbitrary point.

     This navigation controller is base view for every other view controller in the app.
     Understanding how navigation controllers work and what they can and can't do is key to a happy
     developer and app. You can definitely push the envelope, but understanding this first is crucial.
